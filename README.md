Working with the "Trending Youtube Statistics" dataset, found on: https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube/data

I don't know what I'm going to do with the data yet, but most likely some form on sentiment analysis on comments.

## TODOs
- documentation for how to setup and run
- proper preprocessing of comment text (eg. convert to lowercase, remove punctuation and/or stopwords, etc.)

Later:
- feature extraction / spaCy stuff - extracting features
- classification (ideas? classifying a video's category based on its features?)
