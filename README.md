Working with the "Trending Youtube Statistics" dataset, found on: https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube/data

I don't know what I'm going to do with the data yet, but most likely some form on sentiment analysis on comments.

## TODO
Run:
`python3 main/preprocessing.py -i US -o output/preproc.json`

Test:
`python3 main/preprocessing_helpers_test.py`
