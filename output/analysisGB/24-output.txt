trash...no wonder kids now a days grow up having no respect for authority.  Donald Trump is the President of the United States of America. You may not like or respect the man because of whatever reasons, but you should have respect for the title he holds whether you feel he deserves it or not.

Lost respect for Eminem Trump is trying to drain the swamp from the 4 or 5 corrupt last presidents and its no where near easy for him, i wish eminem would leave out politics and he was right about Bush but now he seems to be on the side of evil and when has trump said anything racist? its clear eminem only watches mainstream news
compound: -0.83, pos: 0.12, neg: 0.20, neu: 0.68

As inspiring as these lyrics were and this message is, reading the comments was equally uninspiring and disheartening. It's terrifying to know that no matter what Trump does his supporters will still back him. Eminem used his platform as one of the most well known artist ever (not just rappers) to bring to light issues that are incredibly important and need to be talked about. Charlottesville happened, Vegas happened, The terrible response to Puerto Rico happened, Trumps support of the kkk and obvious racism happened...ohhh and that little thing in North Korea is happening right before our very eyes! Yet you still support him, there's so many more terrifying examples of Trumps awful leadership and yet you still support him no matter what. I so desperately wanted to put a question mark at the end of that last statement but at this point I know it to be fact. Maybe that's why Eminem felt it necessary to draw a line in the sand. I will say it's a sad day when any line needs to be drawn in the sand.

Disney has killed star wars, why does Rey need jedi training?

Too much cgi does the opposite effect its trying to display

I hope all the songs from all the trailers is in the movie. they kind of fit the movie unlike the music of suicide squad. for example this song can be used as the suiting up song of them coming out of the batcave. then come together can be used when superman shows up and helps them fight Steppenwolf.

God‚Äôs Message To Mankind By Maester Patrick (I.S.o.B.P. - International School of Biblical Prophecy - Youtube.com/ISOBP )Accept This Gift: Pray to Jesus and Ask for Your sins to be Covered then Seek Water Baptism.GOD LOVES YOU. However, God does not Condone your sins. ‚ÄúGood‚Äù people Have Committed Sins as well. As You have not lived a Perfect life. Nor has Anyone else. Your sins have Made you a Sinner before God. The Penalty for Your sins is the Curse of Death.However there Is Good news: Someone who never Committed a sin, Can be Your Substitution, such a Person May Carry Your Judgment for Your sins, In Your place.God‚Äôs Love for You Inspired Him to send His son, Who‚Äôs capable of Living a Life Without Sin, and made him undergo the curse of Death in your place.This is How Eternal Life becomes Accessible to you. As Jesus, Gods son, Never Committed A sin during His Earthly Life, so By the Law of Sin and Death, God was obligated to resurrect Him, Rightfully, as that Law Only Applies to Sinners.Eternal life Cannot be Obtained by means of Money, Nor is there a way to ‚ÄúEarn‚Äù the right that God Pardons you from the Curse of Death with your Own Efforts of Recompense for Your Sins. You are unable to ‚ÄúDeserve‚Äù it, It‚Äôs a Gift from God.Its Up to You to Choose if you Accept this Gift, and When You do so, God Arranged the Forgiveness of your sins and Will Choose to Forget that You ever Committed Them.Those Who Accept this Gift will Become Sons and Daughters of God, and No Longer be Separated From Him. Such will Receive Access to the Holy Spirit and Will Dwell in Heaven with God in the Afterlife.After your reunition with GOD, the Holy Spirit Will Help You To Not Return to that old Lifestyle of Committing Sins, Lest You Become Separated from God Again, Nor should You Desire To Be found Abusing God‚Äô Grace Upon You.SOURCE:  Psalm 100:5, Deuteronomy 28, Romans 3:23, Isaiah 59:2, Hebrews 4:15, 2 Corinth 5:21 Hebrews 9:12, John 11:25, Galatians 2:16, Ephesians 2:8, Isaiah 43:25, Galatians 3:26, Romans 6:12, Romans 6:14, Leviticus 26, 1 John 1:8, Romans 6:23, Romans 10:15, Romans5:8, John 3:16, John 17:3, Romans 8:2, Romans 10:13, Acts 2:38, 2 Corinth 5:18, Philippians 3:20, Galatians 2:17-21, Romans 6:15.

I have my thoughts about what the movie can and cannot be, but some of the major shots in this trailer look very low-budget. If this was done correctly you could undoubtedly have the successor to Indiana Jones, but from what I see it is just guns and the occasional jump over a large height. I expected a company like Warner Bros. to know no bounds, but I expected wrong.

Her manager and the rest of her support group went above and beyond to help her.

God‚Äôs Message To Mankind By Maester Patrick (I.S.o.B.P. - International School of Biblical Prophecy - Youtube.com/ISOBP )Accept This Gift: Pray to Jesus and Ask for Your sins to be Covered then Seek Water Baptism.GOD LOVES YOU. However, God does not Condone your sins. ‚ÄúGood‚Äù people Have Committed Sins as well. As You have not lived a Perfect life. Nor has Anyone else. Your sins have Made you a Sinner before God. The Penalty for Your sins is the Curse of Death.However there Is Good news: Someone who never Committed a sin, Can be Your Substitution, such a Person May Carry Your Judgment for Your sins, In Your place.God‚Äôs Love for You Inspired Him to send His son, Who‚Äôs capable of Living a Life Without Sin, and made him undergo the curse of Death in your place.This is How Eternal Life becomes Accessible to you. As Jesus, Gods son, Never Committed A sin during His Earthly Life, so By the Law of Sin and Death, God was obligated to resurrect Him, Rightfully, as that Law Only Applies to Sinners.Eternal life Cannot be Obtained by means of Money, Nor is there a way to ‚ÄúEarn‚Äù the right that God Pardons you from the Curse of Death with your Own Efforts of Recompense for Your Sins. You are unable to ‚ÄúDeserve‚Äù it, It‚Äôs a Gift from God.Its Up to You to Choose if you Accept this Gift, and When You do so, God Arranged the Forgiveness of your sins and Will Choose to Forget that You ever Committed Them.Those Who Accept this Gift will Become Sons and Daughters of God, and No Longer be Separated From Him. Such will Receive Access to the Holy Spirit and Will Dwell in Heaven with God in the Afterlife.After your reunition with GOD, the Holy Spirit Will Help You To Not Return to that old Lifestyle of Committing Sins, Lest You Become Separated from God Again, Nor should You Desire To Be found Abusing God‚Äô Grace Upon You.SOURCE:  Psalm 100:5, Deuteronomy 28, Romans 3:23, Isaiah 59:2, Hebrews 4:15, 2 Corinth 5:21 Hebrews 9:12, John 11:25, Galatians 2:16, Ephesians 2:8, Isaiah 43:25, Galatians 3:26, Romans 6:12, Romans 6:14, Leviticus 26, 1 John 1:8, Romans 6:23, Romans 10:15, Romans5:8, John 3:16, John 17:3, Romans 8:2, Romans 10:13, Acts 2:38, 2 Corinth 5:18, Philippians 3:20, Galatians 2:17-21, Romans 6:15.

Ryan is honestly the greatest youtuber of all time. 10+ years, more than 20 million subscribers, still makes dope content consistently, while not quite as often as he used to. All of his videos are funny, well thought-out, and he clearly puts so much effort into all of them. Even after more then 10 years of making videos, I still enjoy every last one of them. I have grown up watching this channel, and I‚Äôm sure many other people here have as well. I personally believe that Ryan is irreplaceable on YouTube, and that when he finally does decide to ‚Äúhang em up‚Äù, it will be a very sad day. Ryan, I just wanted to thank you for all you have done for everyone who watches your videos, because they are not just a piece of entertainment, but part of who I am. Thank you.Okay that got sappy af but it‚Äôs all true tho

Hi all, I just want to tell you something. Actually what is the problem between apple products with other ?. Do not argue between apple products with others. It suits your needs only. If you are not comfortable with one product, do not compare it with other products. If you do not like it, just be quiet! why argue? you just choose what you like and if you do not like why should compare it with other products?

Lost respect for Gal Gadot a little bit. Shes still a bad ass though! Those two women are good human beings butbthey have lost souls. I will pray for you all to see that God made us the way we are and he didnt want us to change our gender or personality to meet the worlds demand. If you cant find a man right away that doesnt mean that you must degrade yourself to an unholy level. You dont need superficial love to sooth your feelings. Find peace in God. He loves you with all His heart, and much more than any other person will. BTW, this isnt an adult talking or a child. I am a teenaged Catholic, and I feel sorry for the children or innocent minds that may have been corrupted by watching this. Do not mistaken my opinion. I DO NOT HATE GAYS. I discourage and despise what they believe in but I respect them as a person with a soul. I hope i embeded some knowledge into your minds. If you agree or you are Catholic, please like. If you didnt read all the way through, that just proves how lazy your mind is. But if you did and you dint agree, dont blow up. This is an oppinion. Im entitled to one.
