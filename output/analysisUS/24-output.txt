trash...no wonder kids now a days grow up having no respect for authority.  Donald Trump is the President of the United States of America. You may not like or respect the man because of whatever reasons, but you should have respect for the title he holds whether you feel he deserves it or not.

Hey Eminem, let me go ahead and spit at you!I'm gonna tell you straight-up, dude, you're so hypocritical,it's pitiful!You call Trump a racist, yet you call him orange again and again!From what I know, the definition of racism is making fun of one's skin.You think you're such a tough guy? Well, when you battle, it's Hollywood: fake scenes, fake dudes, and film crews!Trump is fighting real enemies of America - ISIS, North Korea, and fake news!You call Trump a Neo Nazi; are you that much of a pinhead?! I mean, put both of you in a police lineup, you're the one that looks like a skinhead!You made your millions on the backs of young black men, infecting the minds of teens, selling them drugs, sex, and sin....NOW you suddenly care about gun violence?! I'm about to lose it!! You are such a hypocrite because YOU GLORIFY GUN VIOLENCE IN EVERY OTHER LINE OF YOUR MUSIC!!!!!!You have a gift for rapping, so why not use it for good,'cause your music has probably killed as many young black kids as your homie planned parenthood!You talk about police brutality? Dude, is it even computing,that you're mad at the same cops that you and your boys rap about shooting?!You think Trump treats women bad? Listen to what YOUR songs say about females! Bro, you are so lost that *cough, cough*..................it's like you're hanging around Hillary's emails.You're mad at Trump because he's rich? You yourself rap about money, so shouldn't he be your hero?Oh wait a minute, you rappers are just jealous because his bank account ends with a couple extra zeros! 😜You act like you fight for civil rights? Raise your black power fist like an OG?Last I checked, Trump donated more money than all of you to the NAACP!So while you used up your skill in your 40's, and your popularity and money are half-spent........You can say what you want about Trump; he is still our president!

I like how DC is starting to really compete with Marvel. Ever since Iron Man, Marvel has dominated even though DC had Nolan's Batman series. But clearly Marvel had a plan and a narrative in which they would carry out their universe over the next 10-20 years whereas DC wasnt really doing that much and they were almost non existent. Now that DC actually has a timeline and direction for the franchise Marvel will have to make sure they can stay on top. DC arent just focusing on Individual movies anymore, and Marvel is somewhat nearing the end of their own timeline. Now DC can focus on trying to take over and they have a good chance of doing it too.

Hahahahahahahahaha! Ahahahahaha!! Yet another pile of shit from the DCEU! What is this, a video game? DC deserves every bit of bad reception their movies receive. That’s what they get for jumping the gun and attempting to create a whole Marvel-like cinematic universe in two movies. They even blew their load too soon within the movies themselves! Introducing Batman without establishing him first in his own standalone film? Killing off Superman in literally the second film in the franchise? And those are not even the numerous “smaller” mistakes, like casting Jessie Eisenberg as Lex Luthor “Jr” or Jared Letto as the Joker. Haha they could have literally just cast Jessie as the Joker and he would have been fine! Also, how about the infamous “Martha” scene? What were the writers thinking?! 😂 I’ve already heard the first cut of JL was “unwatchable” so the trend appears to continue. They done fucked themselves real good and I’m just enjoying the shit show!

Dear movie studios, could you please finally manufacture an original script and just insert the game's skin on top of it? I'd like to use Logan here as an example. At its heart, it was a great drama film with some X and adamantium sprinkled in the mix. It wasn't your basic superhero movie with CGI etc. Someone should take similar action with video game movies and break the cycle. I know creating something new might seem difficult and daunting as we saw with Assassin's Creed. But they lost their way with the 85% modern day stuff. Find the aspect which makes the game amazing and build on that. Just don't just rehash the story from the game because most of us have already spent tens of hours experiencing it.TL;DR Pls break teh cycle and git gud.

I have my thoughts about what the movie can and cannot be, but some of the major shots in this trailer look very low-budget. If this was done correctly you could undoubtedly have the successor to Indiana Jones, but from what I see it is just guns and the occasional jump over a large height. I expected a company like Warner Bros. to know no bounds, but I expected wrong.

How the fuck do ppl praise IT, an embarrassing jump scare CGI movie for morons and basic bitches/bros. yet dislike a trailer for this film even though it looks exactly like the new critically acclaimed games just in live action? It looks fine, yet it gets a worse like ratio than some of the worst movies in Hollywood?

Am I the only one that thinks it looks like the 2nd movie all over again? Beca has career goals and opportunities while the group wants to stick together. There’s another group that challenges them on what they do best. It’s all about doing one last routine with the girls. And I swear if there is a scene where the Bella’s try to to imitate another group, they may as well call it Pitch Perfect 2.5. Also where the hell is Jesse and Benji?!?!?

What do when 90% of your extended family believes these statues should stay up/muh history/white close minded christian conservatives etc, and otherwise are generally kind and decent human beings?How do you not completely hate them for feeling they are ignorant/racist/homophobic/narrow minded when outside of these caveats they are generally kind, loving, honest and decent people? Do I ostracize them or how do I deal with them?They probably also voted for Trump too and I think he's a giant man child and likely one of the worst Republican candidates we've ever had. Do I let our differences in opinion divide us? Do I brush these differences aside?I'm genuinely curious what others think and feel about these issues in dealing with political and cultural/religious/beliefs differences of polar opposite sides in friend family coworkers and loved ones.

Lincoln was not fighting for slave rights at all. He was trying to keep the south from succeeding. It was business. The South's reasons may have been in defense of slavery. But the North was not the hero's crusading for abolition. Monuments are not always reminders of great deeds. Look at 9/11 memorial what does that condone? Terrorism. So, Now We Won't Have Yet Another Freedom. You People Just Keep Giving All Our Freedoms Away! Wake Up All You Dumb Ass's.

After reading some of these comments, I feel compelled to say that the Confederates were not Patriots by any means. In fact they were the total opposite of that. These are not heroes but in fact they were traitors to the USA and  all the values it currently holds to this day. They should be remembered for the sake of history but not honored.

Fair warning to those about to wade into the comments: no matter what you believe, bring popcorn and a barf bag.Also, let's assume that most the soldiers fighting on either side didn't really care about slavery. For the north, they fought because they were part of the military and that was their job (or for the african-american divisions post Emanc.-Proc. for their freedom). For the south, most of them fought because their leadership convinced them that it was the only way. Most of these people were not slave owners.Fair enough, no?But, whatever you say about the ordinary soldiers, for the civilian leadership and at least some of the military leadership of the Confederacy, it was about separating from the north so they could practice slavery in peace without the north constantly complaining about it. For them, it was about slavery. Or, before you say state's rights, the right of their states to practice slavery. To quote the current administration: That's a fact, and you will not deny it.You shouldn't sanitize history. It happened, you can't change it. But, we all know that we can change the way it's remembered, and move confederate history to museums. That's where most of the Union stuff already is. Sorry southerners, but since you lost the war, your ancestors that fought for the Confederacy were traitors, in its most literal definition. There are plenty of other wonderful things the south has given us that don't involve systemic racism whose death throes are still felt even today.Or, if you must have military leaders, here are some better ideas that will offend probably no one in significant numbers:Arkansas: Douglas MacArthur, WW2/Korea five star general.Missouri: Omar Bradley, WW2 five star general. John Pershing, WW1 six star general (a rank he shares only with George Washington! Be fucking proud of this guy, Washington was only given it posthumously, Pershing got it while in action).Texas: Chester Nimitz, WW2 five star admiral (whose grandfather fought for the confederacy).Oklahoma: Ira C. Eaker, WW2 five star air force general.West Virginia: Newton Baker, WW1 secretary of war (whose father was a confederate cavalryman).Like, Kentucky, put up a statue of Col. Sanders in gold plating. You know you want to. Pretty please with a cherry on top?

I really think this is aweful how this issue is portrayed.     black people are by far more responsible for slavery.   I am a vet and I support honoring some one for their service regardless of the reason for the conflict.   should we not honor the vet from the war in Iraq just because you disagree with why the war was started....  I am proud of my country even the slave owners, its part of our history, its part of what made us who we are today, now we have to decide who that makes us in the future.   hopefully not a country full of dumb, lazy, victims.
compound: -0.93, pos: 0.11, neg: 0.22, neu: 0.67

What a joke. Lincoln clearly said he has no intention of abolishing Slavery where it exists. He also gave south state to come back and KEEP slavery as long as they pay 40% tax. Like any other war ever fought it was about money and not righteous cause. (Religion, slavery, greater good, freedom etc) The fact that Confederation had deep roots in slavery economy in no way means war was about slavery this is basic logic.
compound: -0.98, pos: 0.15, neg: 0.35, neu: 0.51

Don't care what anyone says, i think it's fucked up that we're fighting so hard to erase white history and culture that our own people are saying I'm proud that my ancestor was murdered, that's amazing. Is this a trend or are we going to actually see our history erased? It doesn't matter that it was negative shit, all races and cultures and nations have negative shit they've done and to erase that would be not just ignorant, but selfish and pathetic. You don't see people protesting in Africa about some nasty tribal warfare that broke out forever ago and now they're gonna run up on their property and desecrate all the shit they build.. You don't see the actual native Inca decedents in Peru bitching about some You stole our laaaaand bullshit, they just fuckin live.. While you guys are bitching about this pointless bullshit, there are other things we could be mass focusing on to fix our country instead of worrying about our feelings all the time. Until then, America isn't being fixed, it's dying. We all hate each other and hold each other to political or social standards for no reason.

Ryan is honestly the greatest youtuber of all time. 10+ years, more than 20 million subscribers, still makes dope content consistently, while not quite as often as he used to. All of his videos are funny, well thought-out, and he clearly puts so much effort into all of them. Even after more then 10 years of making videos, I still enjoy every last one of them. I have grown up watching this channel, and I’m sure many other people here have as well. I personally believe that Ryan is irreplaceable on YouTube, and that when he finally does decide to “hang em up”, it will be a very sad day. Ryan, I just wanted to thank you for all you have done for everyone who watches your videos, because they are not just a piece of entertainment, but part of who I am. Thank you.Okay that got sappy af but it’s all true tho
