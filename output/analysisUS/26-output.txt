I hate how she has to literally explain her own personal opinion. Like why should anyone try and come for her and her opinion. I also feel she was walking on eggshells with this review because Rihanna is black. And her goons would come for Nikki. But overall boo you were honest and REAL . Don't ever be scared to say what you have to say!

So I just want to say that I followed gabby from the begging since vine and through her transition in to YouTube and I always loved her content until she started posting and uploading things that did not fit with what she normally would post. I thought to myself okay people change and even though I saw this person grow not just in viewers or followers but you know spiritually and emotionally, but her content is something that I no longer am interested in watching or spending time consuming. Yes that sounds harsh but I am just being blunt. My little sister started not too long ago to watch her after seeing her in another YouTuber's video and it caught my interest and I think she said this in one of her other videos but I agree with that person who said it. I truly enjoy watching her videos now, and not to be relatable but her perspective on life and self growth has changed and I am now proud of the example she is setting mental health wise for young viewers everywhere, including my sister so keep it up Gaby and I hope the best for you emotionally spiritually financially and of course health wise stay strong and never give up on your dreams because as you have seen you have been seeing them come true before your eyes. That is not always going to be easy and sometimes you might doubt your judgement but always go with what your gutt is telling you and you will get very far
compound: 1.00, pos: 0.22, neg: 0.04, neu: 0.74

Sorry this is cheesy and stuff but this video is kinda making me want to let it out I was listening to this and realized in my head how many times I've said 'I'm fine' or held my head up when I'm breaking inside but I just pretend everything is fine to make my friends think I'm okay and they don't need to worry about me and I vent to people, strangers, online like I am now about how much I just want to let it out and be sad and say how I'm feeling out loud, mostly because I know they'll never see or even talk to me in my life, but I just want you to know a quote I've heard to many times that is very true, The saddest people smile the brightest. Thanks for reading my vent, I'll be happy to talk to you if your feeling the same way.

After all these year of pain and misery and bottling up my feelings because I was never able to explain the way I feel ,and why I feel that way without feeling like I'm sounding crazy and looking through quotes to find the right words, I think I finally found them, with you, a girl who is funny and always laughing, that I would've never imagined would feel the same as me, and for that I'm extremely thankful ❤

I love the WUNDERBROW2, Nikkie. Life-changing... such a confidence booster. It does have a little learning curve but once you get familiar with it, you can actually make it look more natural. It doesn't smudge, doesn't move, it stays where you put it. So lovely! You have to work fast(er) because it dries easily and it wipes itself off once you go back, but you'll get better at it each time. LOVE IT. At night I take my make-up off with oil first - so this comes off as well - but it is so worth it. It stays put all-day-long, rain or shine!!! Excellent for the beach and/or if you want no other make-up, just to frame your face while at home. I even get compliments now on my brows, never have I ever gotten any. I have the Blond one and use it very gently (soft colour indeed) with a guide. Superb! Haven't used anything else, since I ordered this. The fact that you can trust it, is priceless. xxx

Gabbie my sister always experience that where you are awake but you still have nightmares  and you can't move.If that happens to you again, please don't force your self to move cause it can cause death.
compound: -0.53, pos: 0.07, neg: 0.13, neu: 0.80

This story shows that ghosts are demons.  Why would your grandma scare you to death to tell you something simple? Demons are always watching, which is how they know what's going on in our lives, and they try to manipulate, confuse, and possess.  Mainly they do this by attempting to get us to go to mediums in order to figure out what grandma really wants to say.  That's one of the easiest ways for a demon to get into a person's body because a channel gets opened.  Obviously demons are visiting mediums because grandma went to a medium with a specific personal message for her.  It's not grandma, it's a demon pretending to be someone else, trying to confuse people about the other side, and ultimately trying to get you to go to a medium in an attempt to possess you.

I know what you mean. Sometimes nightmares have the most horrible feeling that you can't explain. A lot of the time it's not the idea of the dream itself that's too scary, but the feeling it leaves is horrific.

Idk wtf everyone's problem is. His reviews are on point. He is very informative and thorough. I really enjoy watching him and his videos. Yes, His face is masculine for makeup but that's not a bad thing it's just different for people who aren't used to it. His makeup style is from what Ive seen always flawless and he knows how to rock the shit outta it. He is definitely bold, and doesn't give a fuck what you pricks think and I admire that. I never thought when I heard his music back then that I'd be sitting here watching him do tutorials and reviews but damn girl I'm soooo happy he does! I've never had the opportunity to try your products but I hear they're pretty damn amazing and can't wait till someday I can! Keep working it!!!

The point of the channel is to watch them attempt popular trends and diy's and stuff like that so we can laugh at their failures and be proud when they succeed, this isn't some professional shit. If you're looking for perfection you're in the wrong place.
